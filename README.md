## Group members:
- Gallo Matteo
- Motta Samuele
- Fiorini Armando
- Khaled Sarahneh

## Implemented functions:
### Advanced functions:
- Multiple games
- Resilience to disconnections
- Chat

### Extra functions:
- Complete rules
- GUI (doesn't work due to copriright reasons)
- CLI

## How to execute the JAR file:
1. Open the terminal and head to the directory in which the file is located.
2. Type ```chcp 65001``` and press enter.
3. Type ```java -jar jarFileName.jar``` and press enter.

**N.B.** Due to the CLI structure, windows 10 users will not be able to see the CLI properly in the terminal, this is because windows 10 cmd doesn't provide ANSI code interpretation.
To mitigate this problem you can try windows 11 terminal or Linux terminal.
